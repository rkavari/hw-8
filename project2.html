After we discussed our independent insights, we developed diverse list of interviewees. For each interviewee, we developed questions to understand their perception of sustainability and how they try to be sustainable in their households. If they are not sustainable, we wanted to understand why that was the case. Each group member was assigned two interviewees, resulting in a total of 12 interviews.</p>

We concluded that the overall theme of the board should be that “Sustainability is chaotic”.</p>

Throughout the journey of completing this project, I feel that I have become stronger at the ideation and user research processes. I am much more comfortable brainstorming and experimenting with potential solutions. I have also become much more assured in my interviewing skills and am no longer as nervous when conducting interviews.<br><br>A potential area of growth that I identified for myself would be to become more experienced with developing a consistent design system. I usually complete design tasks independently and have had limited opportunities to work other designers. For this project, I worked with another designer. I found the final interface to be stylistically inconsistent. Despite agreeing on elements such as font family, font size, color palette, and more, our screens look different from one another. In the future, I hope to learn how to maintain a consistent design style when working with other designers.<br><br>Another area of growth for myself is to learn how to create distinct designs. After reflecting on the screens I created, I found that they looked quite similar to the screens for the Impactify app. Even though we selected different palettes and font families for this project, the apps appear to resemble one another. I am eager to learn how I can have a unique style as a designer without creating designs that appear too similar to one another.
