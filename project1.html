For our final project, we were placed into teams and tasked to develop an innovative solution together. My group consisted of 3 members. My role was to create the app's design and present the prototype during the final showcase for the course. I used Figma to make the high-fidelity design for the app.<br><br>the course ended, I was recruited by a team member to join a similar project, Impactify, a winner of the acclaimed Big Ideas Contest. The Impactify team decided to adopt the design that I had created. In a team of 10, I hold the role of Design Lead. As the design lead, I conducted user research to identify the needs of the audience. Using research insights, I created an app prototype. The prototype was recently presented at the TechFair at Berkeley and secured equity-free funding. I am currently coordinating the design hand-off with the developers. After recently presenting the latest prototype at Techfair at Berkeley, the campus's "premier tech conference for student makers," our team was awarded equity-free funding.</p>

            <p class="page-body">To create a focused solution, our team developed HMW statements that would guide us through our development. We started the course with an initial statement, and after researching the problem area and receiving feedback from our mentor, we narrowed our statement down.The following is our initial HMW statement: “How might we mobilize young people to take action for social impact?“. The following is our revised HMW statement: “How might we activate a feeling of indignation among youth and connect them to social engagement opportunities?“.</p>

            <p class="page-body">Along our journey of conducting user research, we learned that visuals, such as photography or artwork, are a powerful way to evoke feelings of indignation, motivating people to take actions. We were asking ourselves: how can we bring soul-stirring images in the hands of young people? The answer was obvious to us: through an app. We were inspired by the structure of Tinder and how it connects people. For the Gamechangers app, young people can swipe through causes, which are represented by powerful visuals. When users are intrigued, they can dive into the cause by learning about the background of the visual. If they are particularly compelled, they can also connect with organizations working on the issue.<br><br>Once the course ended, Gamechangers transformed into Impactify. Today, Impactify employs a similar structure to Gamechangers. Most of the changes during the transformation were aesthetic. however, there are some structural changes. These structural changes were the result of user research and usability testing. </p>

            <p class="page-body">To better understand our problem area and the needs of our audience, our team conducted an extensive round of research. Through a survey of more than 100 college students, we found that a significant majority deeply cares about social and environmental issues. However, 55% were not able to find suitable engagement opportunities. This statistic guided our research into the problem space. As a team, using reputable online articles and academic papers, we sought out to understand topics such as youth involvement in movements, how the youth consumes the news, and more. To supplement this knowledge, we also spoke with our peers to contextualize our gained knowledge.</p>

            <h2 class="project-subheading">News from Social Media</h2>
            <p class="page-body project-subheading">One of our first major insights from our research was that the youth appears to obtain much of their information and news from social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Because these platforms tend to be highly visual, we found that much of this information tends to be in a visual format and is often aesthetically appealing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
            <h2 class="project-subheading">Importance of Education</h2>
            <p class="page-body project-subheading">The next insight is that education was incredibly important determinant of whether young people cared about causes. After speaking with our peers, we found that if they are not particularly educated about a cause, they appear to be less likely to become involved in the cause.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
            <h2 class="project-subheading">Accessible Opportunities</h2>
            <p class="page-body project-subheading edge">The last insight is that youth often are not informed of ways to participate in causes, at a higher-level. While information about marches and protests tends to be readily accessible, longer-term opportunities were more difficult for our peers to locate.</p>

            <p class="page-body project-subheading">Almost 80% of the respondents said that they often felt the urge to make a positive impact in the community or the world. Interestingly, 100% of our survey respondents indicated that they wished they were more involved in social and environmental causes. 75% of our respondents noted that they felt there barriers limited their involvement in these causes.</p>

            <h2 class="project-subheading">Internet Aesthetics</h2>
            <p class="page-body project-subheading">Our interviews and surveys confirmed that the youth source most of their information from the Internet. 61% of survey respondents and 100% of interviewees answered that they learned about causes through an online source like Google, social media, or news articles. 75% of interviewees noted that it was important for the information to be aesthetically presented.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
            <h2 class="project-subheading">Context is Necessary</h2>
            <p class="page-body project-subheading edge">Through our interviews, we found that 50% wished that there was more context for the images. They did not want to go through the effort of tapping to receive information about the cause. One interviewee mentioned that she felt she formed an opinion about the image before even knowing what it represented.</p>

            <h2 class="project-subheading">Information Architecture Map</h2>
            <p class="page-body project-subheading edge">I also created an information architecture map to understand what screens and features are necessary to provide the best experience for our users.

I have learned that there is so much work involved in creating in app, from ideating to developing.<br><br>While revamping the app design for Impactify, I saw a notable growth in the aesthetic value of the interface. Constantly working with Figma has increased my competency and positively impacted my design skills. I am much more comfortable with quickly making a low-fidelity screen and translating it into high-fidelity on Figma.<br><br>Though I am more comfortable with the UX design process, this experience has taught me that there is still so much more work to be done. I feel like I could have been more efficient and thorough throughout the design stages. I still feel shaky when creating user flow diagrams and information architecture maps, and could definitely benefit from strengthening those skills. I hope that rigorous design studio courses can help me become more secure in the UX design process and a more effective designer.</p>
